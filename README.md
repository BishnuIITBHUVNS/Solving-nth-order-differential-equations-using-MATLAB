# Solving-nth-order-differential-equations-using-MATLAB
This particular program utilizes the Runge-Kutta method to solve any nth order differential equation. The plan here is to perform several iterations based on the inputs given by the user and thus gives me a plot of different values of yi where i âˆˆ N.
